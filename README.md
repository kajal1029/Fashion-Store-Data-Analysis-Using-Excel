### Aim:-

This project was based on a dataset of a sales store and the aim was to find the overall insights of it like which brand has the highest orders, how many orders are coming from B2B, how many orders were placed etc.

### Process:-

* To perform accurate analysis and fetch useful insights, I viewed the data and came forward to fight the missing and abnormality in data.

* After making the data crystal clear for analysis, I took out the basic insights of the dataset with the help of Descriptive Statistical analysis such as **Total Sales, Average Sales, Unique Product Categories, Minimum and Maximum Sales, Midpoint of Data,** etc.

* The next step was to analyze the data by taking a deep dive into it with the help of Pivot Table. I created numerous tables to fetch all the important insights such as *Top 10 States, Orders by Brands, Orders and Sales by Months, B2B orders, Average Amount by Gender and Age-Group, Max Orders by Gender, Product Sizes, and Categories.

* Then comes my favorite step creating a dashboard full of useful insights. I arranged all of them and used storytelling to make the crucial insights speak clearly with the help of Pivot Charts.

### Important Insights:-

* **Amazon** is the most popular brand having **11,016 orders** in 2022.

* **March** was the most profitable month having **₹1.93M sale** and **2,819 Orders.**

* **Maharashtra** holds the first position in the **Top 10 States** having **4,519 orders.**
